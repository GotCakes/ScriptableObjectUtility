# ScriptableObjectUtility
Basic ScriptableObject utility UI for Unity

Allows viewing and editing of all scriptableobjects in a Unity project rather than relying on the project pane

note : Currently WIP. This will be a passively updated project with plenty of issues and missing features I just use for my own stuff.

Usage :

Clone and open as a project or just copy the Editor folder to own project

Open the editor window via Voodoo -> ScriptableObject Viewer

and just let me know of any problems or pull requests.
