# ScriptableObjectUtility
Basic ScriptableObject utility UI for Unity

Allows viewing and editing of all scriptableobjects in a Unity project rather than relying on the project pane

Note : Currently WIP. This will be a passively updated repository that I've used for my own projects, with plenty of missing features I haven't got around to adding yet due to sheer laziness. Shared under MIT license, this project should work as designed without error, if there's any issues then just let me know, it's cool.

Usage :

1. Clone and open as a project to see how it works with the test scriptable objects, or just copy the Editor folder to own project.

2. Open the editor window via Voodoo -> ScriptableObject Viewer.

Voodoo -> PokeScriptable option will be removed later, I wrote that as it lets you create a scriptableobject from script which the main editor will do later anyway. Highlight a script and run PokeScriptable and save the scriptableobject whereever, eeetc.
